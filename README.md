一个基于零工经济理论的网站，把零工改成领功，功是代表奖励的意思。零其实可以表示临时和短工等等。用这样的基础做整合，吧世界上想做短工的人集合一起，后期考虑实践乔布斯所说的临时组建团队是未来流行的工作方式，工作完成团队就可以解散，可是参与工作的人的手机电脑等app软件例如facebook，qq，微信，等建造的群组还在，只是人不在一个地方，或者大家根本hu'bu

A website based on the theory of odd-job economy, which changes odd-job into success, merit is the meaning of reward. Zero can actually mean temporary and short-term work and so on. Use this foundation to integrate, let's gather the people who want to do short-term work in the world. Later, consider the practice of temporary team building as Jobs said is a popular way of working in the future. Teams can be disbanded after work is completed. But app software such as facebook, qqq, Wechat, etc. are built by people who are involved in the work. Still, it's just that people aren't in one place, or that people are basically hu'bu.
